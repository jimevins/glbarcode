@page impl_2d_barcodes Implementing 2D Barcodes


All barcode implementations are derived from the abstract glbarcode::Barcode class.  The glbarcode::Barcode2dBase
subclass of glbarcode::Barcode provides a common framework for the implementation of 2D barcodes.  Therefore, creating new 2D
barcode types (or symbologies) would be typically accomplished by implementing a subclass of this glbarcode::Barcode2dBase class
rather than directly implementing the glbarcode::Barcode class.

@dot
digraph init {
	rankdir=BT;

	node [shape=box style=solid fontsize=8];
	Barcode       [label="glbarcode::Barcode"       fontcolor="#0645AD" URL="@ref glbarcode::Barcode"    ]; 
	Barcode2dBase [label="glbarcode::Barcode2dBase" fontcolor="#0645AD" URL="@ref glbarcode::Barcode2dBase"  ];
	BarcodeXxx    [label="\"Barcode Implementation Xxx\"" ];

	edge [arrowhead=empty];

	BarcodeXxx -> Barcode2dBase ->Barcode;
}

Virtual Methods
---------------

A 2D barcode subclass must implement the following virtual methods (or callbacks):

- glbarcode::Barcode2dBase::validate() -- The validate method is used to test if data is valid for encoding with the intended
  symbology.  Since validity of the data may not be known until it has been through the encoding process, the
  glbarcode::Barcode2dBase::encode() can also be used for validation.

- glbarcode::Barcode2dBase::encode() -- The encode method is used to encode data such that it can later be vectorized.  The encoded
  data is stored in a boolean matrix (glbarcode::Matrix).  If for any reason the data cannot be encoded, this method should
  return a false, otherwise it should return a true.

A barcode subclass may also need to implement the following virtual methods:

- glbarcode::Barcode2dBase::preprocess() -- The preprocess method performs any transformation of the data needed before encoding.  This
  method may be needed to perform a first-pass encoding to translate an extended alphabet into a simpler one.  For example, this could
  be as simple as upshifting lowercase letters into uppercase if the symbology only supports uppercase. It is assumed that the data
  passed to this method has already been validated with the glbarcode::Barcode1dBase::validate() method.

- glbarcode::Barcode2dBase::vectorize() -- The vectorize method converts the encoded data into a list of @ref drawing_primitives
  suitable for rendering.  The glbarcode::Barcode2DBase class provides a default implementation that should be suitable for most
  2D symbologies.  The following protected methods are available to the vectorize implementation to create this list:

  - glbarcode::Barcode::add_line()
  - glbarcode::Barcode::add_box()
  - glbarcode::Barcode::add_text()
  - glbarcode::Barcode::add_ring()
  - glbarcode::Barcode::add_hexagon()

The following figure illustrates the data flow between these methods, which are called by glbarcode::Barcode2dBase::build():

@dot
digraph init {
	node [shape=plaintext style=solid fontsize=8];
	raw_data;
	primitives [label="\"Drawing\nPrimitives\""];

	node [shape=box style=solid];
	validate     [label=validate     URL="@ref glbarcode::Barcode2dBase::validate()"    ]; 

	node [shape=box style=solid];
	preprocess   [label=preprocess   URL="@ref glbarcode::Barcode1dBase::preprocess()"  ];
	encode       [label=encode       URL="@ref glbarcode::Barcode2dBase::encode()"      ];
	vectorize    [label=vectorize    URL="@ref glbarcode::Barcode2dBase::vectorize()"   ];

	node [shape=plaintext style=solid fontcolor="gray"];
	null1 [label=""];
	null2 [label=""];
	step1 [label="Step 1"];
	step2 [label="Step 2"];
	step3 [label="Step 3"];
	step4 [label="Step 4"];

	{rank=same; step1 validate}
	{rank=same; step2 preprocess}
	{rank=same; step3 encode}
	{rank=same; step4 vectorize}

	null1 -> step1 -> step2 -> step3 -> step4 -> null2 [style=solid color="gray"];

	raw_data -> validate;
	validate -> preprocess;
	preprocess -> encode [label=cooked_data fontsize=8];
	encode -> vectorize [label=encoded_data fontsize=8];
	vectorize -> primitives;
}

Registering With The Barcode Factory
------------------------------------

2D barcodes are registered with the barcode factory in exactly the same manner as 1D barcodes.  See @ref impl_1d_barcodes.
