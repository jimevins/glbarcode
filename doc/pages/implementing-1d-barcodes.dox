@page impl_1d_barcodes Implementing 1D Barcodes


All barcode implementations are derived from the abstract glbarcode::Barcode class.  The glbarcode::Barcode1dBase
subclass of glbarcode::Barcode provides a common framework for the implementation of 1D barcodes.  Therefore, creating new 1D
barcode types (or symbologies) would be typically accomplished by implementing a subclass of this glbarcode::Barcode1dBase class
rather than directly implementing the glbarcode::Barcode class.

@dot
digraph init {
	rankdir=BT;

	node [shape=box style=solid fontsize=8];
	Barcode       [label="glbarcode::Barcode"       fontcolor="#0645AD" URL="@ref glbarcode::Barcode"    ]; 
	Barcode1dBase [label="glbarcode::Barcode1dBase" fontcolor="#0645AD" URL="@ref glbarcode::Barcode1dBase"  ];
	BarcodeXxx    [label="\"Barcode Implementation Xxx\"" ];

	edge [arrowhead=empty];

	BarcodeXxx -> Barcode1dBase ->Barcode;
}

Virtual Methods
---------------

A 1D barcode subclass must implement the following virtual methods (or callbacks):

- glbarcode::Barcode1dBase::validate() -- The validate method is used to test if data is valid for encoding with the intended
  symbology.  This method must only validate data that can be encoded successfully as-is or after processing by the optional
  glbarcode::Barcode1dBase::preprocess() method.

- glbarcode::Barcode1dBase::encode() -- The encode method is used to encode data such that it can later be vectorized.  The encoded
  data is usually a list of characters that represent an atomic barcode element.  For example, the following is the character
  encoding used by the Code39 implementation:

  <center>
  | Character | Meaning                           |
  |:---------:|:----------------------------------|
  | N         | A narrow bar.                     |
  | W         | A wide bar.                       |
  | n         | A narrow space (gap between bars) |
  | w         | A wide space (gap between bars)   |
  | i         | Inter-symbol gap                  |
  </center>

  Other encoding examples can be found in the existing barcode implementations.

- glbarcode::Barcode1dBase::vectorize() -- The vectorize method converts the encoded data into a list of @ref drawing_primitives
  suitable for rendering.  The following protected methods are available to the vectorize implementation to create this list:

  - glbarcode::Barcode::addLine()
  - glbarcode::Barcode::addBox()
  - glbarcode::Barcode::addText()
  - glbarcode::Barcode::addRing()
  - glbarcode::Barcode::addHexagon()

A barcode subclass may also need to implement the following virtual methods:

- glbarcode::Barcode1dBase::preprocess() -- The preprocess method performs any transformation of the data needed before encoding.  This
  method may be needed to perform a first-pass encoding to translate an extended alphabet into a simpler one.  For example, this could
  be as simple as upshifting lowercase letters into uppercase if the symbology only supports uppercase. It is assumed that the data
  passed to this method has already been validated with the glbarcode::Barcode1dBase::validate() method.

- glbarcode::Barcode1dBase::prepareText() -- The prepareText method performs any transformation of the data needed before it can be displayed.

The following figure illustrates the data flow between these methods, which are called by glbarcode::Barcode1dBase::build():

Registering With The Barcode Factory
------------------------------------

To be able to register a barcode type with the barcode factory, it must implement a static create method that returns a pointer to a
newly allocated barcode:

@code{.cpp}
using namespace glbarcode;
 
Barcode* BarcodeXxx::create( void )
{
        return new BarcodeXxx();
}
@endcode

This is used to register the barcode using glbarcode::Factory::registerType:

@code{.cpp}
using namespace glbarcode;
 
Factory::registerType( "xxx", &BarcodeXxx::create )
@endcode


Full Example
------------

As a complete example, the following is the glbarcode++ implementation of the Code39 barcode type.

BarcodeCode39.h:
@includelineno BarcodeCode39.h

BarcodeCode39.cpp:
@includelineno BarcodeCode39.cpp

Finally, as a built-in barcode type, the Code39 barcode type does not need to be registered.  If it were a user-defined type,
it would be registered using the glbarcode::Factory::registerType() method:

@code
	glbarcode::Factory::registerType( "code39", &BarcodeCode39::create );
@endcode
